Smokephisticated is a developing project with intent to spread information to the toking community about reputably high quality products accross the massive online market. 

Online shopping can be very *in your face* - so to speak. 

However, we understand that the choice to invest in something is entirely up to you - Smokephisticated exists to deliver diverse recommendations on products from **these** listed sources:

Grasscity.com

Dopeboo.com

Piecepipe.com

The main basis of our recommendations stem from the smoking community itself. We use customer reviews (and our own honest judgment) to find only the *overall* best smoking products for our readers to browse.

Not every piece is made equal and not every toker will value one piece in the same way - For this reason, Smokephisticated aims to recommend products with as much transparency  and diversity as we can in hopes to land our readers on their next go-to piece or accessory.

We look forward to building towards the reputation of a trustworthy voice in the current massive market that is smoking products.

We will view this project as a success when we are able to provide readers with helpful information on toking - and the smoking products available to them.

Smokephisticated's profit stems from affiliate linking. These proceeds will be very largely reinvested back into Smokephisticated to grow the business.

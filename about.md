Smokephisticated is a developing project with intent to spread information to the toking community about reputably high quality products accross the massive online market. 

Online shopping can be very *in your face* - so to speak. 

However, we understand that the choice to invest in something is entirely up to you - Smokephisticated exists to deliver diverse recommendations on products from **these** listed sources:

Discreet packaging is also the norm for all shops. You will recieve your products packed into an unmarked package with no indication of what you're ordering.

The main basis of our recommendations stem from the smoking community itself. We use customer reviews (and our own honest judgment) to find only the *overall* best smoking products for our readers to browse.

Not every piece is made equal and not every toker will value one piece in the same way - For this reason, Smokephisticated aims to recommend products with as much transparency  and diversity as we can in hopes to land our readers on their next go-to piece or accessory.

We look forward to building towards the reputation of a trustworthy voice in the current massive market that is smoking products.

We will view this project as a success when we are able to provide readers with helpful information on toking - and the smoking products available to them.

Smokephisticated's profit stems from affiliate linking. These proceeds will be very largely reinvested back into Smokephisticated to grow the business.

Smokephisticated is currently a work in progress.

Our aim with Smokephisticated is to provide a tool for smokers to use as a guide to the most high quality products.

The main basis of our recomondations stem from the smoking community itself. We use both customer reviews (from as many sources as we can find) and our own judgement to find only the overall best smoking products for our readers.

Not every piece is made equal and not every toker will value one piece in the same way - For this reason, Smokephisticated aims to recommend products with as much honesty and transparency as we can.

We look forward to building towards having the reputation of a trustworthy and transparent voice in the current massive market that is smoking products.

We will view this project as a success when we are able to provide readers with any and all information on toking, and the smoking products available to them.

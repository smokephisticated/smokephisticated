## My Story

My name is Jacob Tuwiner. I'm the owner and creator of Easy PC, a site designed to help the new guy in the computer space. Whether you want to build your first gaming PC or your first cryptocurrency mining rig, I've got you covered.   

I used to be a console gamer back in the day, until I played on my friend's gaming PC for the first time. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw Battlefield 4 in true 1080p resolution with ultra settings, 60 FPS. I also loved raiding someone's base in Rust which is still my favorite game to this day! From that moment on I knew I had to build a gaming PC.

I used some of my bar mitzvah money to build my first gaming PC. I researched which components would best fit my budget and watched tons of videos on YouTube about PC building. 

Then the day arrived. All of my parts finally came in the mail and I assembled my first PC.

Then I turned it on. Nothing happened.

I checked everything and tried again. Nothing.

Then I looked two more times and realized I made a novice mistake. I didn't connect the CPU power cable!

I turned it on again. Bam! Everything was working properly. From that moment on I was a member of the PC gaming community. 

Then I heard about Bitcoin, and I found it quite fascinating. I started researching cryptocurrencies and how they work and honestly I found the topic quite confusing at first. In fact, building my first gaming PC wasn't too easy for me either. 

I figured there were plenty of other people who were in the same situation as me, and it turns out I was right. 

I first made the [Easy PC YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuPW6x4ZBXR06cjmf1wOS2g){:target="_blank"} and eventually this website in order to help those just starting out. Trust me, it's a lot easier than it seems! The hardest part is getting started, and it's all down hill from there. 


## My Current PC Specs

If you're curious about what I'm running in my rig, I'm going to list my specs down below. 

I don't really feel the need to run my games in 1440p or 4K resolution. I'd rather save the money and play in 1080p with medium-high settings with 60+ FPS. That being said, here are my specs: 

* **CPU:** Ryzen 3 1200 Overclocked to 4.0 GHz
* **Motherboard:** ASRock AB350M 
* **RAM:** 2x4GB DDR4 2400 MHz G.Skill Ripjaws V Series
* **Storage:** 240 GB SSD, 120GB SSD, 1TB 7200RPM Hard Drive
* **Graphics Card:** GeForce GTX 1060 3GB 
* **Case**: NZXT Phantom with Blue LEDs
* **PSU:** Corsair 500 Watt Power Supply 

It's not the most expensive build in the world, but it definitely suits my purposes well.

**Although Nucleus is known for their excellent glass pipes, their new line of food grade silicone products are something to pay attention to. The 10" Silicone Straight Tube Bong has the convenience of a silicone bong with the functionality of a glass one. With a melting point of over 1200˚F, you would really have to try to burn this bong. When you are done with your futile burning attempts, throw it in the dishwasher for a simple clean. The included 14mm male bowl is made of clear glass and the 3" 18mm to 14mm removable downstem is made of silicone to reduce breakage. They both slide right out when cleaning is needed. Choose between multiple color options.**

**Ever want to bring along your bong but don't have the room or you're afraid of breaking it? The Fold-A-Bowl is the solution for you. It is a portable silicone bong that folds down to the size of your palm while still being functional. Every Fold-A-Bong is made with 100% medical grade silicone. Besides this material being safe for you to smoke out of, it is also odorless and flavorless so you don't have to worry about whatever you just smoked sticking around after you're done. If you still want some piece of mind, the bong is dishwasher safe for extreme convenience. Each Fold-A-Bong silicone pipe comes with a 9mm composite downstem and a matching 9mm anodized alloy eject-able bowl. Both of these are removable to help in cleaning. This pipe is nearly indestructible so it is perfect for smoking outdoors and on the go. Although it comes with a bowl, it can also be used as a dab rig with a corresponding nail or by simply flipping the bowl, making it into a male joint susceptible for use with a 14mm domeless female nail. It is available in a host of colors. Here are the instructions on how to switch your bowl into a dab rig joint. Simply remove the silicone grommet and and slide from the spring and bowl. Flip the bowl upside down and slide the spring, then grommet, back on. This allows for a 14mm domeless nail to be attached.**

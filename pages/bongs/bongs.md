<h2 class="heading-center">Here's the facts:</h2>

Our ancient ancestors have been ripping bongs (or forms thereof) for over 2400 years.

**And well, their modern-day decendents are absolutely no exception**

Bongs and pipes are one of the most effective and convienient ways to smoke tabacco and dry herb.

 Which is why the bong market is so massive right now - nowadays you're just one Google search away from sifting through bongs and water pipes from all over the world.

 **But where does one even begin to browse?**

**Save yourself** from sifting through shady hit-or-miss websites. Accidentally settling for a cheaply made bong that was worth 1/6 of what you paid is all too easy to do if you're not sure what to look for.

That's the purpose behind this guide - to direct stoners toward quality products in an honest and straight-forward manner.

<h5 class="heading-center">We've searched so you don't have to.</h5>

Shopping all across the web for your next go-to smoking apparatus is no small task. You shouldn't spend a dime until you're both informed about your purchase, and certain that none of your money, time, or precious supply will be wasted on low-quality products.

(Both sites tend to run store-wide sales more times than not)

Each site has their own individual free-shipping policy - as well as solid customer service for any deliverey issues or general questions/concerns you may have.

**Discreet packaging is also the norm for both shops** - just in case you'd rather keep your shopping habits to yourself * wink wink *

To start the list we have a submarine-style percolating monster that will run your wallet around $140. Although this is the most expensive piece on this page, it isn't hard to justify the price when we really look into it.

<h5 class="heading-center">Some prior knowledge you should have about percolation:</h5>

The percolation we refer to takes place when the whole surface of a body of smoke is forced through water.

Percolating pieces like the <a target="_blank" href="http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/stemless-inline-perc-glass-ice-tube-with-double-ring-18-arm-perc-black.html?nosto=nosto-page-category2">Stemless Inline with Double Ring 18-arm Perc</a> is capable of turning high-killing coughing fits into smooth and flavorful rips & satisfying exhales. Much of this capability stems from the *two* percolator devices that this bong proudly hosts.

Your smoke is first routed from your bowl and into the water. Then your smoke is pulled into the horizontal slitted glass tube known as an inline percolator. Percolator slits split your smoke into many tiny bubbles. 

<h4 class="heading-center">Smaller smoke bubbles = more leverage over cooling, filtering, and vaporizing your hits.</h4>

This really just comes down to the fact that an equal amount of smoke divided and seperated into a larger quantity of bubbles would have more overall surface area than fewer large bubbles - giving the water more leverage over these smoke bubbles.

After being broken up into smaller pieces the smoke is sent upward through the chamber and is fed through the double ring tree perc. The tree percolator consists of two layers of arms with two slits at the bottom of each. When water and smoke pass through these slits, like with the inline perc, the smoke bubbles are divided and cooled.

H2O is a *polar molecule*. This means that water magnetically attracts and removes polar contaminants from your smoke, which leaves you with cleaner and smoother tokes (ash/tar/herb). 

At the same time as magnetically removing contaminants molecularly, the temprature difference forces cool water to create steam when mixing with your hot smoke bubbles. This process is very effective at hydrating the harshness of hot smoke; resulting in smooth, vapor-like inhales. 

It is also worth noting that THC is a non-polar substance; so the psychoactive effect in cannabis isn't pulled out of your smoke bubbles when travelling through water.

**Translation: Smaller bubbles = more effective percoation.** 

So now that you know that the kholes and slits in a percolator cool and smooth your inhales by dividing, filtering, and even vaporizing your smoke:

<a target="_blank" href="http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/black-leaf-bird-cage-glass-recycler-bong-with-cage-percolator.html"><img alt="Bird Cage Glass Recycler Bong with Cage Percolator" class="img-middle" src="/img/bongs/bird-cage-recycler.png" /></a>

Like many other Black Leaf percolators, the Bird Cage Glass Recycler is very unique, very effective, and absolutely worth every penny.

**But there's more to it.**

Cage percolators are designed to cool inhales by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tokeofthetown.com/2013/04/glass_class_percolation_diffusion_and_lots_of_tiny_smoke_bubbles_bong_bubbler.php/">diffusing</a> nasty particles from your smoke; this is done when bubbly smoke is pulled through hundreds of tiny holes that strain and clean your bubbles to save your lungs from inhaling as many harmful bits in your smoke.

**As you've probably noticed:** 

This bong has *two* chambers for both your smoke and your water to travel through. This is where the "Recycler" funtion comes into play.

**But how does it work?**

As soon as your inhale takes place so does the funtionality of the recycler. Both water and smoke gets cycled through in a rotative motion, pulling your smoke back through those tiny holes causing additional percolation again, and again, and again. 

**Why is this important?**

This isn't by any means an essential piece to smoking herbs, but it is both helpful with keeping your hits from going stale, and with adding extra filtration for extra smooth hits. Plus, it's mesmorizing as fuck.

**Features:**

* Borosilicate glass material.

* Built-in Cage Percolator.

* Recycler functionality for continuous filtration.

* Flared mouthpiece for comfortable lip purchase.

* 14.5mm female joint.

* Black "BirdCage" logo located on the main chamber.

* 14.5mm male herb bowl with clear handle for convienient lifting.

* Comes complete with decorative foam box providing safe shipping and a safe place to repackage for future use.

<h2 class="heading-center"><a target="_blank" href="http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/black-leaf-glass-ice-bong-with-triple-honeycomb-disc-perc-38cm.html">Black Leaf's Triple Honeycomb Disc Percolator</a> -  38 cm / 15 inches - $125</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/black-leaf-glass-ice-bong-with-triple-honeycomb-disc-perc-38cm.html"><img alt="Triple Honeycomb Disc Perc" class="img-middle" src="/img/bongs/honeycomb-disc.png"/></a>

Black Leaf is well known for their scientific glass master-pieces - and this Triple Disc Honeycomb Perc is just another shining example.

When smoke travels down from the bowl and through the chamber it is forced to squeeze and strain through tiny holes - this diffuses/seperates lung-harming particles from your smoke and makes for smoother and cleaner tokes; allowing you to take bigger and more comfortable rips.

**But as you've noticed** this is a *triple* honeycomb percolator.. Meaning smoke is processed and filtered through these tiny holes not once, but three seperate times.

<h5 class="heading-center">Safety First</h5>

Having the ability to remove shitty pieces and parts (that don't even get you stoned) from your smoke, while keeping the full rich flavor of your strains, is a tool that every smoker should possess. 

Do yourself *and* your toking-group's lungs a favor and pick up a serious percolator like this beauty. 

<h5 class="heading-center">A Complete List of Features:</h5>

* Borosilicate glass material.

* Blue-trimmed, round-footed base for self-standing.

* Fixed, stemless designed route from your bowl to the chamber. Less moving parts = more stability, right? Either way you'll find reinforcement from the connecting glass from the route into the body itself.

* Three honeycomb disc percolators vertically fixed evenly throughout the chamber.

* Integrated screen to hold every last bit in the bowl until you've decided your supply is beat.

* 18.8mm sliding-glass bowl with an attached blue handle for lifting to clear your chamber and to stop itself from rolling.

* Black Leaf's HoneyComb label. Just Beecause.

* Ice nothches located at the neck to make for *even smoother* frosty inhales.. Will you even realize you're smoking?

* Rounded smooth edges for comfortable mouth purchasing.

*Highly* suggested for begginers:

**Unfortunetly** your local coffee shop probably won't let you sit down at a booth and torch a bowl of this beautifully simple glass piece. Or, at least not yet. Pass the time by celebrating cannabis liberty with 21 cm of [borosilicate glass](https://apaviata.com/advantages-of-borosilicate-glass){:target="_blank"} equipped with the [Coat of arms of Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Amsterdam){:target="_blank"} vector.

Pack your supply into the funnel-bowled 14.5mm chillum and clear the smoke using the carb hole; rip & repeat as nescessary.

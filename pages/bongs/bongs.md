**What you need to know about percolation:**

Percolators are pieces that use water to filter/strain nasty lung-harming particles from your smoke before entering your lungs. This proscess of filtration is reffered as "diffusion" of the smoke. I highly encurage any aspiring smoker to read <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tokeofthetown.com/2013/04/glass_class_percolation_diffusion_and_lots_of_tiny_smoke_bubbles_bong_bubbler.php/">TokeoftheTown's</a> article for clarification.

When the typical smoker thinks of "gravity bong", an image of a dirty cut-up 2-liter bottle inside of a bucket filled with water may come to mind. Generally the bowl would have been made from a socket jammed into a hole in the plastic cap, but as sketchy as these contraptions were... They delivered. 

Something about hitting a gravity bong gets you to a different high; one that bowls and regular bongs just can't always serve, all while using the least amount of your supply.

**Now, let me introduce to you: The Gravitron.**

Relive the glory days of hiding from your parents behind your shed and highschool-party craftsmanship with this sleek, even more effective, glass replacement.

Replacing those sketchy plastics and metals with glass, the Gravitron features a base for water, a glass funnel for you to pack your "tabacco" of choice into, a rubber stopper to prevent glass-on-glass collision, and of course the bottle pipe to lift for the artificial inhale.

Go see the Gravitron in action by watching the video on DopeBoo's website [here](https://www.dopeboo.com/products/gravitron-xl-pipe?aff-43){:"_blank"}

**1.** Those dedicated stoners over at [Black Leaf](https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/brands/black-leaf-glass){:target="_blank"} really know what they're doing. 

With a slick look, effective design (and not to mention 150+ reveiws while still averaging a 5-star rating on Grasscity) this 30 cm German engineered golden-boy is well worth the sub-$50 spend.

**Features:**

* Made from [borosilicate glass](https://apaviata.com/advantages-of-borosilicate-glass){:target="_blank"} (a highly heat resistant and commonly used glass in bongs & pipes).

* Ash Catcher - The ash catcher makes for easy and convienient clearing, while keeping dead-beat ash out of your water. However lazy stoners beware: this is a double edged sword as the catcher can be a difficult cleaning job.

* Clear, slitted 4-arm tree percolator for diffusion - No idea what that means? No worries; to elaborate: 

 Golden-boy over here is designed to cool your milky smoke while traveling from your "tobacco" to your tarry lungs.

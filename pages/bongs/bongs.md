Ultimate percolation - countinuous filtration.

Like many other Black Leaf percolators, the Bird Cage Glass Recycler is very unique, very effective, and absolutely worth every penny.

The birdcage perc is the spherical glass device sitting at the center of the main chamber, hosting an immense number of tiny holes around it's perimeter that diffuse your smoke as it passes through.

With level three percolation, this recycler bong is designed to deliver rips with outstanding freshness.

**But there's more to it.**

The 'recycler' function turns this Black Leaf water pipe into a stoner's paradox. 

This bong has *two* chambers for both your smoke and your water to travel through. This is where the recycler comes into play.

A miniture whirlpool forms at the top of the 2nd chamber - all leftover smoke is sent through this chamber to get *recycled* back through. This form of percolation works very well to diffuse your hits while keeping your smoke from going stale.

**But how does it work?**

As soon as your inhale takes place so does the funtionality of the recycler. Both water and smoke gets cycled through in a rotative motion, pulling your smoke back through those tiny holes causing additional percolation again, and again, and again.

Everyone loves the Triple Honeycomb Disc Perc. Even hearing the name is cause for excitement and curiosity.

With three percolating honeycomb strainers lining the main chamber, the Triple Honeycomb Disc is a water pipe with some serious diffusing power.

Keep in mind, we don't decide these ratings - 30 real customers from grasscity have rated this piece at an insane average of 4.9/5.

**Let's look into why:**

Well, first off I'd mention the quality rips that this piece is capable of. Three honeycomb discs alone produce superb diffusing - stack some cubes on that ice catcher and you'll have ice cold *clouds* emitting from your lungs.

It's also almost hypnotizing to watch this pipe in action. The way that the honeycomb discs filter smoke and create whirlpool eddies as the water settles is very fascinating & fun to watch.

Dodge splash-back with the Bent Neck Matrix.

Matrix percolators are notorious for prodicing massive amounts of bubbles for diffusion - this bubbly ability makes for tremendously smoother rips.

This amount of percolation would cause spash-back with many other pipe designs, but the bent neck provides that extra bit of security. Having a bent neck on your pipe is also a lot more ergonomic when torching your supply.

The process of percolation cools, filters, and even vaporizes smoke bubbles while maintaining THC - add cold water for an ice-cold rip that will blast your to the moon.

All in all, the Bent Matrix is a very well rounded water pipe for dry herb, and (with the purchase of the quartz banger nail attachment - $7) this bong is capable of very quality dab rips.

Those dedicated stoners over at [Black Leaf](https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/brands/black-leaf-glass){:target="_blank"} don't mess around. 

With a sleek design and a reputably effective build - this 30 cm German engineered golden-boy is well worth the sub-$50 spend.

**Features:**

* Made from [borosilicate glass](https://apaviata.com/advantages-of-borosilicate-glass){:target="_blank"} (a highly heat resistant glass commonly used glass in bongs & pipes).

* Ash Catcher - The ash catcher makes for easy and convienient clearing, while keeping dead-beat ash out of your water. However lazy stoners beware: this is a double edged sword as the catcher can be a difficult cleaning job.

* Clear, slitted 4-arm tree percolator for diffusion - No idea what that means? No worries; to elaborate: 

 Golden-boy over here is designed to cool your milky smoke while traveling from your "tobacco" to your tarry lungs.

Percolators are pieces that use water to filter/strain nasty lung-harming particles from your smoke before entering your lungs. This proscess of filtration is reffered as "diffusion" of the smoke.

When the typical smoker thinks of *gravity bong*, an image of a dirty cut-up 2-liter bottle inside of a bucket filled with water may come to mind. Generally the bowl would have been made from a socket jammed into a hole in the plastic cap, but as sketchy as these contraptions were... They delivered. 

Something about hitting a gravity bong gets you to a different high; one that bowls and regular bongs just can't always serve, all while using the least amount of your supply.

**Now, let me introduce to you: the Grav Bong, by Nucleus.**

<a target="_blank" href="https://dankstop.com/products/nucleus-grav-bong?aff=1112"><img alt="grav bong by nucleus" class="img-middle" src="/img/bongs/nucleus-grav-collage.png" /></a>

Relive the glory days of hiding from your parents behind your shed and highschool party craftsmanship with this sleek, even more effective glass replacement.

Replacing those sketchy plastics and metals with glass, the Gravitron features a base for water, a glass funnel for you to pack your tabacco or herb of choice into, a rubber stopper to prevent glass-on-glass collision, and of course the bottle pipe to lift for the artificial inhale.

*Highly* suggested for begginers:

**Unfortunetly** your local coffee shop probably won't let you sit down at a booth and torch a bowl of this beautifully simple glass piece. Or, at least not yet. Pass the time by celebrating cannabis liberty with 21 cm of [borosilicate glass](https://apaviata.com/advantages-of-borosilicate-glass){:target="_blank"} equipped with the [Coat of arms of Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Amsterdam){:target="_blank"} vector. 

Pack your supply into the funnel-bowled 14.5mm chillum and clear the smoke using the carb hole; rip & repeat as nescessary.

Now, for the cheapest in price, but still a very solid little pipe standing at 18 cm.

Besides the charming design - this highly rated piece has a number of features, including:

* An acrylic build (providing durability and light weight)

* Removable metal downtube and bowl for durability and convienient cleaning. 

* Carb hole towards the side for easy clearing of the chamber.

* Included rubber carb stopper for air-tight pulls while torching your supply. 

Make sure to fill your chamber with water until the liquid reaches where the bulged lines intersect on the body. This will help provide the best pulls.

Oh and don't let the simplicity or price of this piece fool you - this bubble bong has a 5-star rating stemmed from over 160 reveiws on Grasscity.

Please Note: The unique colors dipicted in the picture may not be the excact design you find in the mail.

### [Bird Cage Glass Recycler](http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/black-leaf-bird-cage-glass-recycler-bong-with-cage-percolator.html){:target="_blank"}

<a target="_blank" href="http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/black-leaf-bird-cage-glass-recycler-bong-with-cage-percolator.html"><img alt="Bird Cage Glass Recycler Bong with Cage Percolator" class="img-middle" src="/img/bongs/bird-cage-recycler-collage.png" /></a>

**The Bird Cage Glass Recycler's three levels of percolation:**

**Level one:** The first level of percolation featured by the Birdcage Glass Recycler is seen when smoke enters the water directly from the downstem.

**Level two:** At this point, the Birdcage perc is tearing larger smoke bubbles into copious amounts of much smaller bubbles.

**Level three:** This is where the Recycler comes into play. By using the extra chamber, smoke is processed back into the Birdcage for even further diffusing.

**Why is the recycler important?**

This isn't by any means an essential piece to smoking herbs, but it is helpful with keeping your hits from going stale. You'll also find added filtration gives extra smooth hits. Also, not gonna lie - it's fun to watch.

Bird Cage Glass Recycler Bong also features a flared mouthpice for a more comfortable smoking experience.

With a 14.5mm female joint, the included borosilicate glass herb bowl is equipped with a transparent rollstopper that can be used for convenient lifting whilst clearing your chamber.

comes as a complete set up with a male 14.5mm borosilicate glass herb bowl with a transparant handle/rollstopper for easy liftin

Also, this pipe comes representing Black Leaf - as it should. This piece comes packaged in a Black Leaf box (inside of the discreet Grasscity standard plain brown privacy box) with foam interior for security. You'll also find a Black Leaf logo sticker on the pipe itself.

## [Black Leaf Triple Honeycomb Disc Percolator](http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/black-leaf-glass-ice-bong-with-triple-honeycomb-disc-perc-38cm.html){:target="_blank"}

<a target="_blank" href="http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/black-leaf-glass-ice-bong-with-triple-honeycomb-disc-perc-38cm.html"><img alt="Triple Honeycomb Disc Perc" class="img-middle" src="/img/bongs/honeycomb-disc.png"/></a>

Aside form percolation, notice the reinforcement between the bowl and main chamber. This is a small detail that makes a world of difference for the structural integrity of this piece. Not saying that you're entirely safe to drop this glass pipe, but every little bit could help.

Clear the chamber by simply using the blue handlebar to lift your bowl.

You can also find an itegrated screen inside the bowl. **But here's the deal:** Not everyone is a fan of the integrated screen - most people love it, but sometimes people would prefer a bowl design that wouldn't need a screen in the first place. However, I peronally appreciate that little bit of insurence from sucking green back into the chamber. Many bowls seem to decide, if you will, when your pack is beat by sucking it right into the chamber

The Triple Honeycomb Disc proudly stands on a clear & blue round foot base.

Black Leaf also rounded the edge of the top of the pipe for a more comfortable purchase for your mouth.

Taking a break from funtionality for a second, the pipe also comes branded with a sticker. But not just any sticker - I mean, just look at this little bee mascot:

<a target="_blank" href="http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/black-leaf-glass-ice-bong-with-triple-honeycomb-disc-perc-38cm.html"><img alt="Triple Honeycomb Disc Percolator" class="img-middle" src="/img/bongs/honeycomb-disc-mascot-canvas.png"/></a>

Seriously. I want a thousand of these little stickers, I'd put 'em everywhere.

**The brand:** *Black Leaf* is a highly recognized German producer of quality glass pieces and remarkable percolators.

**Perc Level:** The Triple Honeycomb Disc utilizes water, giving it a starting level of 1. Adding for the three honeycomb discs (one level per perc device), this beauty graduates into a level four percolating water pipe.

### [Nucleus Bent Neck Matrix](https://goo.gl/4jvY4J){:target="_blank"} - $74.99</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/4jvY4J"><img alt="Nucleus Bent Matrix" class="img-middle" src="/img/bongs/nucleus-bent-matrix.png" /></a>

**Which will it be: blue pill or red pill?**

Okay, maybe this water pipe alone won't tear the fabric of your reality - maybe.

However, the Matrix percolator does have potential to elevate your smoking experience on a daily basis.

**The Bent Matrix is a well rounded daily driver**

The black accented mouthpiece is a nice touch for comfortability, this feature makes a better lip purchase while taking hits.

This pipe has a sturdy design by hosting a round glass black foot

<a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/4jvY4J"><img alt="Nucleus Bent Matrix" class="img-middle" src="/img/bongs/nucleus-bent-matrix-perc.png" /></a>

The matirx perc itself produces an impressive amount of bubbles - even for a percolator device.

*Stoner Tip:* Use ice water for extra cool & satisfying rips.

Between the bomb percolator, the ergonomic bent neck, and the sleek design by Nucleus - the Bent Matrix is a community favorite.

& with a near 5-star customer rating, Nucleus themselves are very reputable.

Nucleus is a New Jersey, USA based company that prides themselves in providing consumers with reliable products while maintaining affordability. Nucleus actually consults with local glass blowers to make sure that their glass is as quality as possible.

This piece wouldn't be complete without the Nucleus logo featured directly above the percolator.

Dankstop usually sells this item for $74.99, but be sure to check out any sales that they might have!

<a target="_blank" href="http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/blaze-glass-tower-ice-bong-with-double-8-arm-perc-7mm-straight-tube.html"><img alt="Blaze Glass Tower Ice Bong with Double 8-arm Perc 7mm Straight Tube" class="img-middle" src="" /></a>

The Tower Bong by Blaze Glass is made from thick 7mm clear borosilicate glass, with a heft and sturdiness that you can feel when you hold it! Stacked in the cylinder are two 8-arm tree percolators, individually fused at their bases for shock-proof glass construction!

As the smoke travels through the slits of the 8-arm percolators it gets broken up into smaller particles, increasing the surface area, allowing the smoke to cool for a much more gentle hit that is smooth on the throat and lungs. The ice notches give you the option to place a few ice cubes in the tube of the bong, for a perfectly chilled hit.

Its 18.8mm joint comes equipped with an 18.8mm > 14.5mm slitted diffuser downstem and a 14.5mm slide bowl is also included with your purchase. The tube of this straight percolator bong is 50mm in diameter at the mouthpiece and 65mm in diameter below the three extra-long ice notches for extra volume capacity. A high-gloss silver Blaze glass logo is placed on the top of the tube.

<a target="_blank" href="http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/black-leaf-bird-cage-glass-recycler-bong-with-cage-percolator.html"><img alt="Bird Cage Glass Recycler Bong with Cage Percolator" class="img-middle" src="/img/bongs/bird-cage-recycler.png" /></a>

Like many other Black Leaf percolators, the Bird Cage Glass Recycler is very unique, very effective, and absolutely worth every penny.

**But there's more to it.**

Cage percolators are designed to cool inhales by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tokeofthetown.com/2013/04/glass_class_percolation_diffusion_and_lots_of_tiny_smoke_bubbles_bong_bubbler.php/">diffusing</a> nasty particles from your smoke; this is done when bubbly smoke is pulled through hundreds of tiny holes that strain and clean your bubbles to save your lungs from inhaling as many harmful bits in your smoke.

**As you've probably noticed:** 

This bong has *two* chambers for both your smoke **and** your water to travel through. This is where the "Recycler" funtion comes into play.

**But how does it work?**

As soon as your inhale takes place so does the funtionality of the recycler. Both water and smoke gets cycled through in a rotative motion, pulling your smoke back through those tiny holes causing additional percolation again, and again, and again. 

**Why is this important?**

This isn't by any means an essential piece to smoking herbs, but it is both helpful with keeping your hits from going stale, and with adding extra filtration for extra smooth hits. Plus, it's mesmorizing as fuck.

**Features:**

* Borosilicate glass material.

* Built-in Cage Percolator.

* Recycler functionality for continuous filtration.

* Flared mouthpiece for comfortable lip purchase.

* 14.5mm female joint.

* Black "BirdCage" logo located on the main chamber.

* 14.5mm male herb bowl with clear handle for convienient lifting.

* Comes complete with decorative foam box providing safe shipping and a safe place to repackage for future use.

**What you need to know about percolation:**

Percolators are pieces that use water to filter/strain nasty lung-harming particles from your smoke before entering your lungs. This proscess of filtration is reffered as "diffusion" of the smoke. I highly encurage any aspiring smoker to read <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tokeofthetown.com/2013/04/glass_class_percolation_diffusion_and_lots_of_tiny_smoke_bubbles_bong_bubbler.php/">TokeoftheTown's</a> article for clarification. It's a 5 minute read at the most, and well-worth it.

<h2 class="heading-center"><a target="blank" href="https://billowby.com/products/medibubbler-smooth-bubble-bubbler?aff=43">MediBubbler</a> - 7 in / 17.78 cm - $99.99</h2>

If you search for the MediBubler online you'll find the same phrase everywhere: **"Guarenteed to be smooth."**

Wheather you're looking to produce tiny tokes or massive clouds; this thing is known for being easy on the lungs.

**And there's good reason behind that:**

This bong is equipped with a variety of features to support that milky smoooth claim, including:

* The charming body shaped like a water-holding bubble.

* A removable glass mouthpiece that expands outwards towards to lips for comfortble mouth purchase.

* A removable glass slide to make clening jobs a breeze.

	* On the glass slide is a 7-slitted inline percolator that provides filteration in your smoke; diffusing harmful particles from your inhales. Percolation also helps produce way more, tinier bubbles to seperate your smoke and cool your hits in rips big and small.

* Toward the top of the MediBubbler's bosy is a Carb hole for additional airflow with just the lift of a finger.

**The MediBubbler is smokephistication in it's finest.**

When the typical smoker thinks of "gravity bong", an image of a dirty cut-up 2-liter bottle inside of a bucket filled with water may come to mind. Generally the bowl would have been made from a socket jammed into a hole in the plastic cap, but as sketchy as these contraptions were... They delivered. 

Something about hitting a gravity bong gets you to a different high; one that bowls and regular bongs just can't always serve, all while using the least amount of your supply.

**Now, let me introduce to you: The Gravitron.**

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.dopeboo.com/products/gravitron-xl-pipe?aff=43"><img alt="Grav Labs Gravitron Gravity Bong - XL" class="img-middle" src="/img/bongs/gravitron-gravity-bong.png" /></a>

Relive the glory days of hiding from your parents behind your shed and highschool-party craftsmanship with this sleek, even more effective, glass replacement.

Replacing those sketchy plastics and metals with glass, the Gravitron features a base for water, a glass funnel for you to pack your "tabacco" of choice into, a rubber stopper to prevent glass-on-glass collision, and of course the bottle pipe to lift for the artificial inhale.

Go see the Gravitron in action by watching the video on DopeBoo's website [here](https://www.dopeboo.com/products/gravitron-xl-pipe?aff-43){:"_blank"}.

Those dedicated stoners over at [Black Leaf](https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/brands/black-leaf-glass){:target="_blank"} really know what they're doing. 

With a slick look, effective design (and not to mention 150+ reveiws while still averaging a 5-star rating on Grasscity) this 30 cm German engineered golden-boy is well worth the sub-$50 spend.

**Features:**

* Made from [borosilicate glass](https://apaviata.com/advantages-of-borosilicate-glass){:target="_blank"} (a highly heat resistant glass commonly used glass in bongs & pipes).

* Ash Catcher - The ash catcher makes for easy and convienient clearing, while keeping dead-beat ash out of your water. However lazy stoners beware: this is a double edged sword as the catcher can be a difficult cleaning job.

* Clear, slitted 4-arm tree percolator for diffusion - No idea what that means? No worries; to elaborate: 

 Golden-boy over here is designed to cool your milky smoke while traveling from your "tobacco" to your tarry lungs.

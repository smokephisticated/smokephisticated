<a target="_blank" href="http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/black-leaf-4-arm-perc-bong-with-ash-catcher-blue.html"><img alt="Black Leaf 4-arm Perc Bong with Ash Catcher" class="img-middle" src="/img/bongs/4-arm.png" /></a>

**1.** Those deticated stoners over at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/brands/black-leaf-glass">Black Leaf</a> really know what they're doing. 
With a slick look, effective design (and not to mention 150+ reveiws while still averaging a 5-star rating on Grasscity) this 30 cm German engineered golden-boy is more than worth the sub-$50 spend.

**Features:**

* Made from <a target="_blank" href="https://apaviata.com/advantages-of-borosilicate-glass">borosilicate glass</a>, which is a highly heat resistant and commonly used glass in bongs & pipes.

* Ash Catcher - The ash catcher makes for easy and convienient clearing, while keeping dead-beat ash out of your water. However lazy stoners beware: this is a double edged sword as the catcher can be a difficult cleaning job.

 * Clear, slitted 4-arm tree percolator for diffusion - No idea what that means? No worries; to elaborate: 
 Golden-boy over here is designed to cool your milky smoke while traveling from your "tobacco" to your tarry lungs... talk about stone-cold. 
 <a target="_blank" href="(https://herb.co/marijuana/news/what-are-percolators-and-how-do-they-help)" >Percolation</a> comes from the Latin word *percolare*, which means "to strain through." 
 Long sciency story short; diffussion and percolation cools and filters your smoke, making inhaling easier on the lungs. Feel free to follow those links. We'll be wating here for you whenever you feel infomed.

Besides the charming design; this highly rated piece features an acrylic build (providing durability and light weight), and a removable metal downtube and bowl for very convienient cleaning. A carb hole on the side makes for easy clearing, and the included rubber carb stopper makes for air-tight pulls while torching your sweet supply.

**Unfortunetly** your local coffee shop probably won't let you sit down at a booth and torch a bowl of this beautifully simple glass piece... At least not yet; pass the time by celebrating cannabis liberty with 21 cm of <a target="_blank" href="https://apaviata.com/advantages-of-borosilicate-glass">borosilicate glass</a> equiping the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Amsterdam">Coat of arms of Amsterdam</a> vector. Pack your supply into the funnel-bowled 14.5mm chillum and clear the smoke using the carb hole; rip & repeat as nescessary.

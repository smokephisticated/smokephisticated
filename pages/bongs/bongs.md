Our ancient ancestors have been ripping bongs (or forms thereof) for over 2400 years, and their modern-day decendents are absolutely no exception (For good reason)

Bongs are one of the most effective, and convienient ways of smoking dry herb. Which is why the bong market is so massive right now.

*In fact,* nowadays you're just one split-second Google search away from shopping for *millions* of bongs and water pipes from all over the world... But where does one even begin to browse?

To start the list we have a submarine-style percolating monster that will run your wallet around $140. Although this is the most expensive piece on this page, it isn't hard to justify when we really look into it.

<h5 class="heading-center">So let's dive right in:</h5>

Percolating pieces like the Stemless Inline Glass 18-arm Perc turn high-killing coughing fits into long, smooth, and flavorful uninterrupted rips & exhales. 

This is made possible by the *two* percolators that this bong hosts.

The first percolator that your smoke is routed through is the inline perc - which makes for smoother hits by straining your smoke through the horizontal tube leading into the chamber. 

Before your inhale routes your smoke to your mouth, it is first routed to the in-line tube, whose job is to strain smoke into the chamber. the smoke first gets strained through the 18 tiny slits located at the bottom of the in-line tube. When smoke is pulled through these tiny slits, it is forced to travel through the chamber in the form of many, very small smokey bubbles.

H2O is a polorizing molecule, which attracts non-polar contaminants utilize water and filters to defuse lung harming particles from your smoke inhales.

Now, the Stemless Double Ring actually utilizes both an inline percolator and a tree percolator. Your smoke first gets filtered through 

<h2 class="heading-center"><a target="_blank" href="http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/black-leaf-bird-cage-glass-recycler-bong-with-cage-percolator.html">Bird Cage Glass Recycler Bong with Cage Percolator</a> - 30 cm / 11.8 in - $129</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/black-leaf-bird-cage-glass-recycler-bong-with-cage-percolator.html"><img alt="Bird Cage Glass Recycler Bong with Cage Percolator" class="img-middle" src="/img/bongs/bird-cage-recycler.png" /></a>

Like many other Black Leaf percolators, the Bird Cage Glass Recycler is very unique, very effective, and absolutely worth every penny.

**But there's more to it.**

Cage percolators are designed to cool inhales by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tokeofthetown.com/2013/04/glass_class_percolation_diffusion_and_lots_of_tiny_smoke_bubbles_bong_bubbler.php/">diffusing</a> nasty particles from your smoke; this is done when bubbly smoke is pulled through hundreds of tiny holes that strain and clean your bubbles to save your lungs from inhaling as many harmful bits in your smoke.

**As you've probably noticed:** 

This bong has *two* chambers for both your smoke and your water to travel through. This is where the "Recycler" funtion comes into play.

**But how does it work?**

As soon as your inhale takes place so does the funtionality of the recycler. Both water and smoke gets cycled through in a rotative motion, pulling your smoke back through those tiny holes causing additional percolation again, and again, and again. 

**Why is this important?**

This isn't by any means an essential piece to smoking herbs, but it is both helpful with keeping your hits from going stale, and with adding extra filtration for extra smooth hits. Plus, it's mesmorizing as fuck.

**Features:**

* Borosilicate glass material.

* Built-in Cage Percolator.

* Recycler functionality for continuous filtration.

* Flared mouthpiece for comfortable lip purchase.

* 14.5mm female joint.

* Black "BirdCage" logo located on the main chamber.

* 14.5mm male herb bowl with clear handle for convienient lifting.

* Comes complete with decorative foam box providing safe shipping and a safe place to repackage for future use.

<h2 class="heading-center"><a target="_blank" href="http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/black-leaf-glass-ice-bong-with-triple-honeycomb-disc-perc-38cm.html">Black Leaf's Triple Honeycomb Disc Percolator</a> -  38 cm / 15 inches - $125</h2>

<a target="_blank" href="http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/black-leaf-glass-ice-bong-with-triple-honeycomb-disc-perc-38cm.html"><img alt="Triple Honeycomb Disc Perc" class="img-middle" src="/img/bongs/honeycomb-disc.png"/></a>

Black Leaf is well known for their scientific glass master-pieces - and this Triple Disc Honeycomb Perc is just another shining example.

When smoke travels down from the bowl and through the chamber it is forced to squeeze and strain through tiny holes - this diffuses/seperates lung-harming particles from your smoke and makes for smoother and cleaner tokes; allowing you to take bigger and more comfortable rips.

**But as you've noticed** this is a *triple* honeycomb percolator.. Meaning smoke is processed and filtered through these tiny holes not once, but three seperate times.

<h5 class="heading-center">Safety First</h5>

Having the ability to remove shitty pieces and parts (that don't even get you stoned) from your smoke, while keeping the full rich flavor of your strains, is a tool that every smoker should possess. 

Do yourself *and* your toking-group's lungs a favor and pick up a serious percolator like this beauty. 

<h5 class="heading-center">A Complete List of Features:</h5>

* Borosilicate glass material.

* Blue-trimmed, round-footed base for self-standing.

* Fixed, stemless designed route from your bowl to the chamber. Less moving parts = more stability, right? Either way you'll find reinforcement from the connecting glass from the route into the body itself.

* Three honeycomb disc percolators vertically fixed evenly throughout the chamber.

* Integrated screen to hold every last bit in the bowl until you've decided your supply is beat.

* 18.8mm sliding-glass bowl with an attached blue handle for lifting to clear your chamber and to stop itself from rolling.

* Black Leaf's HoneyComb label. Just Beecause.

* Ice nothches located at the neck to make for *even smoother* frosty inhales.. Will you even realize you're smoking?

* Rounded smooth edges for comfortable mouth purchasing.

**What you need to know about percolation:**

Percolators are pieces that use water to filter/strain nasty lung-harming particles from your smoke before entering your lungs. This proscess of filtration is reffered as "diffusion" of the smoke. I highly encurage any aspiring smoker to read <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tokeofthetown.com/2013/04/glass_class_percolation_diffusion_and_lots_of_tiny_smoke_bubbles_bong_bubbler.php/">TokeoftheTown's</a> article for clarification. It's a 5 minute read at the most, and well-worth it.

When the typical smoker thinks of "gravity bong", an image of a dirty cut-up 2-liter bottle inside of a bucket filled with water may come to mind. Generally the bowl would have been made from a socket jammed into a hole in the plastic cap, but as sketchy as these contraptions were... They delivered. 

Something about hitting a gravity bong gets you to a different high; one that bowls and regular bongs just can't always serve, all while using the least amount of your supply.

**Now, let me introduce to you: The Gravitron.**

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.dopeboo.com/products/gravitron-xl-pipe?aff=43"><img alt="Grav Labs Gravitron Gravity Bong - XL" class="img-middle" src="/img/bongs/gravitron-gravity-bong.png" /></a>

Relive the glory days of hiding from your parents behind your shed and highschool-party craftsmanship with this sleek, even more effective, glass replacement.

Replacing those sketchy plastics and metals with glass, the Gravitron features a base for water, a glass funnel for you to pack your "tabacco" of choice into, a rubber stopper to prevent glass-on-glass collision, and of course the bottle pipe to lift for the artificial inhale.

**Unfortunetly** your local coffee shop probably won't let you sit down at a booth and torch a bowl of this beautifully simple glass piece... At least not yet; pass the time by celebrating cannabis liberty with 21 cm of [borosilicate glass](https://apaviata.com/advantages-of-borosilicate-glass){:target="_blank"} equipped with the [Coat of arms of Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Amsterdam){:target="_blank"} vector. 

Pack your supply into the funnel-bowled 14.5mm chillum and clear the smoke using the carb hole; rip & repeat as nescessary.

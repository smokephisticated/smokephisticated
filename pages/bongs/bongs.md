**1.** Those deticated stoners over at Black Leaf really know what they're doing. With a slick look, effective design (and not to mention 150+ reveiws while still averaging a 5-star rating on Grasscity) this 30 cm German engineered golden-boy is more than worth the sub-$50 spend.

**Features:**

* Made from [borosilicate glass](https://apaviata.com/advantages-of-borosilicate-glass/) - borosilicate glass is a highly heat resistant glass. All you really *need* to know about it is that it's a good common material for glass bongs.

* Ash Catcher - The ash catcher makes for easy and convienient clearing, while keeping dead-beat ash out of your water. However lazy stoners beware: this is a double edged sword as the catcher can be a difficult cleaning job.

 * Clear, slitted 4-arm tree percolator for diffusion - No idea what that means? No worries; to elaborate: Golden-boy over here is designed to cool your milky smoke while traveling from your "tobacco" to your tarry lungs... talk about stone-cold. Percolation comes from the Latin word *percolare*, which means "to strain through." Long sciency story short; diffussion and percolation cools and filters your smoke, making inhaling easier on the lungs. Feel free to follow those links. We'll be wating here for you whenever you feel infomed. [Percolation](https://herb.co/marijuana/news/what-are-percolators-and-how-do-they-help)

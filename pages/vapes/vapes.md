Everyone who loves to smoke weed should try vaping at least once in their life.

Not only do you reach a whole new level of high, but it's convenient, different from the norm, and makes you feel like a pro.
Vaping has become extremely popular in the last few years.

Thanks to that, you have so many different choices to choose from on how you want to vape, and that's pretty dope if you ask us.

So today, it's time to learn something new.

Let's get into how to vape weed like a pro.

## Vaping vs. Smoking

There's a lot of advantages that come along with vaping weed.

Let's start with the fact that it's cheaper.

That's right. If you vape weed, you're saving money.

That's because when you use a vaporizer, the vapor goes straight from the chamber to your mouth.

You can also turn a vape on or off anytime you want.

If you're smoking, your weed is burning, whether you're inhaling or not.

So keep in mind, vaping might be ideal if you're a heavy toker.

You might also prefer vaping if you don't want to smell like smoke. 

While you will smell like dank for a second when you take a hit, the smell evaporates almost immediately. The scent won't stick to your clothes either. 

So if you're going to something like a family event, vaping is your best choice.

To top it off, you'll experience a whole different and [more intense high](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2716990){: target="_blank"}

Your high will feel cleaner and more clear-headed. You'll also most likely feel energized and creative, rather than a couch potato.

## Different Ways to Vape Weed

<img alt="" class="lazyload img-middle" data-src="/images/vapes/how-to-pro-vape/types-of-vaping-cbd.jpg">

There are three different kinds of devices you can use to vape.

Table-top/desktop vapes, portable vapes, and vape pens (also known as an oil pen).

A table-top vape is bigger and plugs into a wall. It's ideal if you only plan on using it at home.

Portable vapes are cheaper and smaller. You can fit them in your pocket and take them anywhere with you.

Vape pens are the most popular. True to their name, they're usually as small as a pen. They're the cheapest, easiest to use, and you can take them anywhere.

Here are the different types of weed you can vape:

*Dry herb

*Liquid THC

*Dab (also known as wax, oil, shatter, etc.)

When using a vape pen, you can vape with a disposable cartridge, refillable cartridge, or you can use the heating chamber, which is usually for dry herbs.

The cartridges can be CBD cartridges or THC cartridges. Whatever works best for you.

## How to Use a Vape Pen for the First Time

If you don’t know how to use a vape pen for weed, you can use dry herbs, oil, and liquid THC.

In this case, we'll focus on how to use a dry herb vape pen.

Keep in mind that not every pen is the same, so be sure you read the directions before using it.

**Step #1) Charge the battery**

First things first, you're going to want to charge the battery. Most pens already come charged, but check just in case.

Always make sure to do this before a vape sesh or before you head out with your pen, or else you'll have to wait.

**Step #2) Grind the weed**

Grind your weed up so that it can fit into the pen's chamber.

If you really want to be a pro, you should invest in a grinder if you don't already have one.

If not, you can tear the kush apart with your hands.

**Step #3) Load weed into the chamber**

Place your cannabis into the heating chamber. Make sure not to pack it too tight so that there's airflow.

If you're using cartridges for an oil pen, you would skip the last two steps, and screw it onto where the heating chamber is.

**Step #4) Press the button on the side**

This step depends on the type of vape pen you're using.

Some vape pens have a button on the side that you'll usually press 3 to 5 times to turn on and heat the weed.

Other types don't have a button, and all you'll need to do is inhale.

**Step #5) Inhale while holding the button down**

Once the vape is ready, put your mouth on the mouthpiece and inhale while pressing down on the button.

<div class="watch-out">
	<h4>Warning:<i class="box-icon-spacing fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i></h4>
	<p>Do not try to take a fat rip like you're hitting a pipe or a bong.</p>
	<p>Like we mentioned earlier, the high from a vape is more intense. Small inhales are more than enough, especially if you're a novice.</p>
</div>

It may feel like you're not inhaling anything, but trust me, you are. 

Remember, it's vapor, not smoke.

Instead, take a small hit, and wait to see how you feel.

## How to Use a Disposable Vape Pen

<img alt="" class="lazyload img-middle" data-src="/images/vapes/how-to-pro-vape/nature-vape-exhale.jpg">

There are all kinds of disposable vapes like THC pods, but vape pens are the most convenient and discreet.

Disposable vape pens are so easy to use, a grandma can do it. No joke.

All you have to do is choose the type of dab cart you want to smoke, and that's it.

The pen will come ready, and you won't need to load your weed or screw on the cartridge.

1. Take your vape out of its package.

2. If the pen has a button, press it to turn it on.

3. Put your mouth on the mouthpiece and inhale. If there is a button, hold it down as you inhale.

4. Exhale.

That’s it! You can continue to use it until it runs out.

Store it in a cool, dry place in the meantime.

Once you finish it, throw it out.

If you're eco-friendly, the best place to take it would be at a [Hazardous Materials Management Facility](https://www.epa.gov/hwpermitting/hazardous-waste-management-facilities-and-units){:target="_blank"}

But if that's the case, you're better off investing in a long-term vape pen.

## What is a Dab Pen?

<img alt="" class="lazyload img-middle" data-src="/images/vapes/how-to-pro-vape/dab-glob.jpg">

Dab pens (also known as wax pens) are used solely for dabs.

You can't vape dry herbs or liquid THC with them.

It has the same components as a vape pen but works a little differently.

You'll need a dabber (or a dab tool) and an airtight container to store your dabs.

You can also use a dab pen cartridge.

## How to Use a Dab Pen

**Step #1) Charge the battery**

Just like a vape pen, always make sure to charge the battery.

**Step #2) Use the dabber to load your pen**

Unscrew the top off of your dab pen and open up your dab container.

Use your dabber to scoop out some dab from the container and load it into the heating chamber.

Make sure you never touch the wax, as it can stick to your fingers and ruin the oil.

If you're using a dab cart, you'll simply screw it onto the dab pen.

**Step #3) Turn on the dab pen**

Press the button on the side to turn on your dab pen. It usually takes 3 to 5 times.

**Step #4) Inhale while pressing the button**

Put your mouth on the mouthpiece and inhale while holding the button down.

Remember, dabs are super concentrated, meaning you're going to get higher than usual.

Take a small, short hit and see how you feel.

## How to Clean a Vape

Don't let your vape pen get clogged up, or else you won't get the most out of your hits.

First, remove the mouthpiece, chamber, and battery from each other.

Clean the mouthpiece with a sanitizing wipe.

Next, grab a q-tip and lightly dip it in alcohol. Wipe the chamber with it, but not too hard so that you don't damage it.

And that's it! Now you have a clean and good-as-new vape.

## Conclusion

Now that you know how to use a vape pen, it's time to call yourself a pro.

You've officially reached a new level on your stoner journey.

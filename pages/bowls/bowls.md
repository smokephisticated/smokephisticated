<h2 class="heading-center">Here's the facts:</h2> 


A stoner's go-to bowl says a lot about them.

A solid bowl is like a stoner's right hand.

*In fact,* nowadays you're just one split-second Google search away from shopping for *millions* of bongs and water pipes from all over the world... But where does one even begin to browse?

**Save yourself** from sifting through shady hit-or-miss websites. Accidentally settling for a cheaply made bong that was worth 1/6 of what you paid is all too easy to do if you're not sure what to look for.

That's the purpose behind this guide - to direct stoners toward quality products in an honest and straight-forward manner.

<h5 class="heading-center">We've searched so you don't have to.</h5>

Shopping all across the web for your next go-to smoking apparatus is no small task. You shouldn't spend a dime until you're both informed about your purchase, and certain that none of your money, time, or precious supply will be wasted on low-quality products.

Our bowl recommendations currently consist of products from two community-trusted online headshops:

* [Dopeboo.com](http://www.dopeboo.com?aff=43){:target="_blank"}

* [Grasscity.com](http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/){:target="_blank"} 

(Both sites tend to run store-wide sales more times than not)

Each site has their own individual free-shipping policy - as well as solid customer service for any deliverey issues or general questions/concerns you may have.

**Discreet packaging is also the norm for both shops** - just in case you'd rather keep your shopping habits to yourself * wink wink *

But why should you hear us out?

<h5 class="heading-center">Our recommendations are sourced straight from the community:</h5>

Our suggestions strongly stem off of genuine customer feedback left by real and satisfied stoners that have gone through the exact deciding process as you are now.

So wheather you're hoping to upgrade from make-shift bottles and cans, or if you're browsing for an addition to your collection - your future go-to piece could be found right on this page.


<h3 class="heading-center">Please Note:</h3>

<a target="_blank" href="http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/jet-flash-smoke-system.html"><img alt="Jet Flash Smoke System" class="img-middle" src="/img/bowls/jet-flash-collage.png" /></a>

Standing in a league of it's own, the online smoking community raves about the Jet Flash Smoke System.

**Here's why:**

Aside form the fact that you can play around with the pieces of the Jet Flash to fit other pipes and bongs;

The Jet Flash also utilizes the *Venturi Effect*. This essentially boils down to the effect of your smoke being forced from one chamber, into a confined tube, and then back into another chamber.

& how does this affect your smoking experience?

[Bernoulli's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli's_principle){:target="_blank"} states that an increase in the speed of a fluid (or, in this case air/smoke) occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy.

So, when smoke is pulled through the tight funnel (between the pistol grip and the main vortex chamber) it increases in speed, and thus decreases in pressure; this lack of pressure accelerates the force of outside air flooding into the Flash Chamber from the three angled carb holes that surround the body of the Flash.

But there's even more to it: Because these carb holes are designed at an angle, air that floods in is forced into a spiral which results in a vortex of smoke. 

This technique provides extra cooling effect by empowering the ambient air over the surface of low pressure smoke. Less pressure + high spiraling velocity = an intense cooling vortex effect that allows you to rip head-imploding clouds.

Forcing smoke into a vortex even keeps tar residue away from the chamber walls, keeping it slightly cleaner than your average dry pipe.

The highly versitile Jet Flash Smoke System ships with three different adapters of your choosing:

* **Funnel Bowl** - The funnel is a rotation favorite. Pour water into the pistol grip chamber before sliding the slitted percolating downstem into the grip. Then place the packed funnel bowl down into the downstem; this results in a bowl that holds enough for many, and a hit that is smooth enough for everyone.

* **Spoon Pipe** - Standard and convenient. The spoon is your standard dry pipe attachment equipped with two roll stoppers for stability; a modern take on a true classic.

* **One Hitter** - Quick and conservitive. This single person option will rip harder and smoother than any dug-out. Add water to utilize the slitted downstem for percolation, all while saving herb like a soner-pro.

**Added bonus:** The one hitter doubles as a joint/blunt holder; stuff your roll-of-choice into the bowl and never burn your fingers again! (Add water for an extra smooth percolated roll!)

Altogether, the Jet Flash is seperated into 7 seperate pieces. Outside of the three attachments listed above, the System is shipped with: 

* **Pistol grip/percolation chamber** - able to hold water for percolation, hosts ergonomic grip for comfort and security

* **Main glass chamber** - sends smoke into your lungs at a spiraled angle using three carb holes

* **Slitted 18.8 mm > 14.5mm 6-slitted diffusing downstem** (11cm, length) - adds smooth percolation to your hits when you decide to add water to the Pistol Grip

* **Keck clip** - secures both the pistol grip, or the spoon pipe to the Flash Chamber

Plus, The Jet Flash System even ships wtih a secure foam-fitted travel case!

Using the same vortex chamber as the Jet-Flash hand pipe, angled pinholes in the chamber of this Blaze Glass Jet Flash Mini Joint Turbo pipe create a smoke-cooling swirling action when you inhale, resulting in silky smooth smoke that’s less harsh on your throat and lungs. Made of 5mm-thick quality borosilicate glass, this pocket-sized pipe has a carb hole, black glass bead rollstopper and the Blaze Glass and Flash logos emblazoned in silver

Blaze Glass Jet Flash Mini Joint Turbo 8,4cm ~ Small enough to fit in your pocket but with the Kick of a bong, this little gem allows you to get the same 'Flash' kick from a joint as you normally get from a 'Jet Flash' bong. 

 

Internally there are 3 Vortex-Notches' which spin the smoke in a spiral, filling the Flash chamber, before the 'kick-Hole' is released. With the 'Blaze Glass' logo, in silver down the 'Vortex Chamber' and a black 'Roll-Stop' nodule this is sure to be a big hit at festivals and parties.

Simple, cheap, and effective - This Glass Shabong Steamroller is one of Grasscity's highest rated pieces in it's budget-pipe class.

In fact, the community has heavily vouched for the ripping power of this little shabong.

This piece is **not** meant to be filled with water.

The Glass Shabong features:

* This Steamroller hosts a clear glass bowl that conveniently sits ontop of it's body that feeds smoke into the chamber.

* Transparent glass - clearly see when the chamber is filled with silky smoke from the bowl

* Carb hole for clearing - once the chamber fills with smoke, use your finger or palm to cover this hole as you inhale. Remove your finger to clear the smoke from the chamber - Placed at the end of the pipe, closer the bowl-piece

* Rimmed mouth piece for comfortable lip purchase/inhaling - Placed at the front of the pipe, further from the bowl-piece

* Hemp leaf logo on body - Gotta represent, right?

* Roll-Stopper - Located opposite of the bowl, the roll-stopper literally prevents your piece from rolling and spilling your bud

* Ships with metal screens - This piece works much better with a screen sitting in the bowl. Pick up a few extras and save yourself from having to spit out ash and herb later. Select the 15.9 mm size for the best fit: [Screens](https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/steel-screens-various-sizes-100x.html){:target="_blank"}

& as you've hopefully noticed, this piece isn't actually *large*, but rather the larger version of itself. See the even smaller [small shabong](http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/small-glass-shabong.html){:target="_blank"}

<h2 class="heading-center">We're here to guide you to your next bowl/hand pipe purchase</h2> 

The purpose of this guide is to introduce smokers to a diverse list of the most reputably high quality tabacco/medical herb bowls within multiple online headshops.

<h5 class="heading-center">Our recommendations are sourced straight from the community:</h5>

We search for the highest quality bowls by looking directly at genuine customer feedback. These reviews come from real stoners that have gone through the exact deciding process as you are now, and were satisfied enough to leave glowing reviews and recommendations.

<img alt="Rating Example" class="img-middle" src="/img/bowls/rating-example.png" />

Don't waste your time sifting through low-rated and low quality products. We've done the leg-work for you by compiling a diverse list of the highest quality bowls of all price ranges - you're bound to find a reasonably priced piece you love, with an informative description.

Our suggestions stem from three community-trusted sites:

* [Dopeboo.com](http://www.dopeboo.com?aff=43){:target="_blank"}

* [Grasscity.com](http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/){:target="_blank"} 

(Both sites tend to run store-wide sales more times than not)

As well as the Piece Pipe from [Piecepipe.com](https://www.originalpiecepipe.com/?afmc=2f){:target="_blank"}

**Oh, and relax;** Discreet packaging is also the norm for all three shops. You will recieve your products packed into an unmarked package with no indication of what you're ordering.

<h3 class="heading-center">Please Note:</h3> 

<h5 class="heading-center">Seeing products a little out of your price range? Don't sweat it. Our lower-priced recommendations are towards the bottom. Scroll down until you find the range that fits your budget.</h5>

Jet-Flash Smoke System
Whirling smoke, using the Venturi system, begins in the small nozzles in the body of the chamber.

The design of the funnel body aerates the smoke, cooling it and making it easier to inhale. The same air intake holes along the shoulders of the pipe force the smoke away from the walls and keep the funnel body clean.

The Jet Flash System allows you to switch between several types of smoking adapters to suit your mood. The complete 7-piece kit comes with a handheld glass chamber with molded grips, a glass funnel bowl, mouth piece chamber, a spoon pipe adapter, a taster "one hitter" adapter/joint holder, a slitted 18.8mm > 14.5mm slit diffuser downstem, and a Keck clip to securely hold the pieces together while in use. The Jet Flash system can be used on its own or as an attachment on your regular bong.

Simple, cheap, and effective - This Glass Shabong Steamroller is one of Grasscity's highest rated pieces in it's budget-pipe class.

This Steamroller hosts a clear glass bowl that conveniently sits ontop of it's body.

This piece is **not** meant to be filled with water.

The Glass Shabong features:

* Transparent glass

* Toking hole - Use your finger or palm to cover this hole as you inhale, once the chamber fills with smoke, remove your finger to clear the smoke from the chamber - Placed at the front of the pipe, further from the bowl-piece

* Carb hole for clearing - Placed at the end of the pipe, closer to the bowl-piece

* Hemp leaf logo on body - Gotta represent, right?

* Roll-Stopper - Located opposite of the bowl, the roll-stopper literally prevents your piece from rolling and spilling your bud

* Rimmed mouth piece

* Ships with metal screens - This piece works much better with a screen sitting in the bowl. Pick up a few extras [here], and save yourself from having to spit out ash and herb later.

& as you've hopefully noticed, this piece isn't actually *large*, but rather the larger version of itself. See the even smaller [small shabong](http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/small-glass-shabong.html){:"_blank"}

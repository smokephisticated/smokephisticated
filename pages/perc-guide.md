The word *Percolation* is defined as the process of liquid slowly straining though a filter. This stems from the latin term "Percolare" - Which translates into "To strain through".

**But what does percolation *really* have to do with smoking out of water-pipes?**

To use as an example, we will be looking at the:

Percolators like these are capable of turning high-killing coughing fits into smooth and flavorful rips & satisfying exhales - this is very largely attributed to the *two* percolator devices that this bong hosts.

Your smoke is first routed from your bowl and into the water - altering a cloud into large and dense smoke bubbles. 

As the smoke is pulled, it travels horizontally into the horizontal tube. This tube is reffered to as an 'inline percolator' because of the 18 slits along the bottom. These slits split your bubbles into tiny pieces, resulting in many tiny bubbles that are now travelling through the pipe.

<h4 class="heading-center">Smaller smoke bubbles = more leverage over cooling, filtering, and vaporizing your hits.</h4>

This really just comes down to the fact that an equal amount of smoke divided and seperated into a larger quantity of bubbles would have more overall surface area than fewer large bubbles - giving the water more leverage over these smoke bubbles.

After being broken up into smaller pieces, the smoke is sent upward through the chamber and is fed through the double ring tree perc.

The tree percolator consists of two layers of arms with two slits at the bottom of each arm. When water and smoke pass through these slits, like with the inline perc, the smoke bubbles are divided and cooled.

<h3 class="heading-center">Sure that makes sense, but how exactly does that filter/clean your smoke?</h3>

Well, H2O is a *polar molecule*. This means that water actually *magnetically attracts* polar contaminants from your smoke bubbles.

Tar, ash, and tabacco or herb particles are all examples of polar molecules that would be magnetically affected by H20. Of course, this effect leaves you with healthier and smoother tokes.

**It is also worth noting that THC is a non-polar substance.** So - contrary to popular belief - the psychoactive effect in cannabis isn't pulled out of your smoke bubbles when travelling through water.

**But that's not even all**

Water doesn't only magnetically remove contaminants molecularly - But the temprature difference between hot smoke and cool water forces the creation of steam. 

This process adds hydration and cooling power to hot smoke - resulting in smooth, vapor-like inhales. 

After learning about all of these benifits, it is up to you wheather to invest in a percolator or not.

The word *Percolation* is defined as the process of liquid slowly straining though a filter.

But what does percolation *really* have to do with smoking out of water-pipes?

To use as an example, we will be looking at the: <a target="_blank" href="http://affiliates.grasscity.com/shop/clickthru.cgi?id=Smokephisticated&page=https://www.grasscity.com/us_en/stemless-inline-perc-glass-ice-tube-with-double-ring-18-arm-perc-black.html?nosto=nosto-page-category2">Stemless Inline with Double Ring 18-arm Perc</a>. Percolators like these are capable of turning high-killing coughing fits into smooth and flavorful rips & satisfying exhales - this is very largely attributed to the *two* percolator devices that this bong hosts.

Your smoke is first routed from your bowl and into the water - altering a cloud into large and dense smoke bubbles. 

As the smoke is pulled, it travels horizontally into the horizontal tube. This tube 18 all split your bubbles into tiny pieces 

<h4 class="heading-center">Smaller smoke bubbles = more leverage over cooling, filtering, and vaporizing your hits.</h4>

This really just comes down to the fact that an equal amount of smoke divided and seperated into a larger quantity of bubbles would have more overall surface area than fewer large bubbles - giving the water more leverage over these smoke bubbles.

After being broken up into smaller pieces the smoke is sent upward through the chamber and is fed through the double ring tree perc. The tree percolator consists of two layers of arms with two slits at the bottom of each. When water and smoke pass through these slits, like with the inline perc, the smoke bubbles are divided and cooled.

H2O is a *polar molecule*. This means that water magnetically attracts and removes polar contaminants from your smoke, which leaves you with cleaner and smoother tokes (ash/tar/herb). 

At the same time as magnetically removing contaminants molecularly, the temprature difference forces cool water to create steam when mixing with your hot smoke bubbles. This process is very effective at hydrating the harshness of hot smoke; resulting in smooth, vapor-like inhales. 

Percolator slits split your smoke into many tiny bubbles. This gives water much more leverage over cooling, filtering, and vaporizing your hits. This really just comes down to the fact that an equal amount of smoke divided and seperated into a larger quantity of bubbles would have more overall surface area than fewer large bubbles - giving the water more leverage over

It is also worth noting that THC is a non-polar substance; so the psychoactive effect in cannabis isn't pulled out of your smoke bubbles when travelling through water.



For example, we will be walking you through  stems from Latin - Percolare "To strain through"

"Percolation" - the process of a liquid slowly passing through a filter. Percolation originates from the Latin word percolare, or "to strain through."

The percolation we refer to takes place when the whole surface of a body of smoke is forced through water.

Real talk:

When it comes to conserving herb and sending your rotation to the moon, bongs are king.

That being said, how exactly do these water pipes work, and why are they so damn effective?

We’re going to cover everything from the basics on how to smoke a bong, to the science behind bong percolation and weed diffusion. 

To top it off, we’ve added a few recommendations on percolator bongs toward the bottom of the guide.

So spark up and zone in—it’s time to get Smokephisticated.

## What is a Bong Used For? 

A bong is used to smoke cannabis while utilizing the benefits of percolation. 

This process helps to cool smoke, hydrate inhales, and filters contaminants (ash, tar, herb). 

Bongs are a good method for conserving your supply while simultaneously delivering one hell of a high. 

## Do Bongs get You Higher than Blunts? 

Think about it this way: 

When you're smoking a bunt, the cherry (the of the blunt that's lit) is always rolling.

That means marijuana is being burned, even when you're not inhaling. 

Moreover, when you're smoking a blunt, there isn't any water to cool or filter the smoke, meaning the hits are going to be more harsh than a bong. 

Lastly, blunts don't have a collection chamber for the smoke. Unlike a bong, which allows you to collect smoke in a large chamber before clearing the whole thing at once, blunts burn straight into your lung. 

They hit more harshly, and the hits aren't as big. 

Aside from a dab rig, bongs are the best way to smoke. 

## Bong Science: Weed Percolation & Water Diffusion

As a method of smoking cannabis, bongs are flavorful, conservative, and satisfying to watch.

However, bongs—also referred to as water pipes—have one key advantage over dry hand pipes, joints, and blunts.

This advantage is the process of percolation.

This bubbly phenomenon cools, hydrates, and filters polar contaminants from the smoke.

With regards to smoking, percolation is a fancy way of referring to what happens when smoke is entirely surrounded by water.

Although bongs can drastically vary in size, structure, and design, all true bongs have the capacity to hold water, thus utilizing percolation.

So, are all water pipes are percolator bongs?

Well, not necessarily.

Although every bong is capable of percolation, pipes referred to as percolator bongs host percolator devices that diffuse your smoke for stronger percolation effects.

We’ll cover percolator devices—also known as percs later on.

Most stoners understand that a water bong causes a smoother hit, but a truly Smokephisticated toker understands the hows and whys of this process.

First things first, let’s talk about percolation. 

## What's the Point of Water in a Bong? 

When it comes to bongs, water is pretty important.

Water cools and filters smoke, while hydrating your inhales. 

Without water, bongs wouldn't have percolators, which are primarily responsible for bongs' reputation of getting you high as fuck. 

## What is Percolation? 

The word percolation is defined as the process of straining liquid through a filter. 

This stems from the Latin term percolare, which directly translates as: to strain through. 

Percolation takes effect in many different forms throughout the world – like when you’re brewing a pot of coffee – but the percolation that we will be referring to is the process of air and smoke passing through water as bubbles.

Different pieces that use water have different routes to diffuse cannabis smoke depending on their structure (more on this later), but the premise of percolation has several advantages. 

All of the effects begin when your bubbles submerge in the water until they resurface. A longer percolation process gives water a more time to affect your weed smoke, resulting in a smoother hit..

Enough beating around the kush—let's dive into the three main effects of smoking out of a percolator bong:

## Benefits of Percolation 

There are many benefits of percolation, including: 

### 1. Cooler Smoke 

The difference in temperature between smoke and aerated water causes a heat transfer, resulting in cooler smoke and more enjoyable hits.

	<p>Even room-temperature water will cool smoke – but if you use ice water instead, your rips will be frosty and smooth.</p>
</div>

### 2. Hydrated Inhales

As hot smoke travels through water, steam is introduced into each smoke bubble.

The same temperature difference that cools the smoke also fills your future inhale with steam. 

This process adds a smooth vapor-like property to your bong rips without diluting flavor or THC.

### 3. Filtration 

Water, or H2O, pulls/attracts residual particles and filters your smoke on a magnetic molecular level.

The magnetic relationship between H2O and polar contaminants/particles is much simpler than it sounds.here's the deal:

## The Chemistry Breakdown 

Put simply, polar molecules attract other polar molecules.

Water is very polar; H2Ois actually the most polar protic solvent. Substances that can pull through bowls like residual herb, resin, or ash are polar as well—so some of the harmful shit that you're usually inhaling through a dry pipe is magnetically pulled from smoke as it passes through water.

Heads up: Stoner bros will sometimes claim that you will lose out on your precious THC in the percolation process, and you’ll dull your high by smoking from a water pipe.

Let’s investigate this claim.

## Is THC lost through the process of percolation?

Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is a lipid (examples of lipids would be oils or fats) meaning THC is mostly non-polar. 

That being said, water does not magnetically pull THC out of your smoke as it does with polar particles; you may lose trace amounts of THC, but it wouldn’t be anything to fiend over.

If you compare the number of harmful particles that are pulled from your inhales, to the trace amount of THC lost—percolation is worth the miniscule trade.

Smoother rips are also much easier to inhale, which allows you to take larger hits compared to a dry piece.

So at the end of the day, you're getting bigger and cleaner rips. Larger inhales = more THC per rip.

With that being said, that stoner bro probably heard the same claim by another smoker who is also uninformed. Break the cycle with your newfound facts on percolation.

## Bubbles Stay Busy

When smoke submerges, it doesn’t enter as one single bodied pocket. Instead, smoke bubbles into many little bodies before returning to air.

But between the two events, these smoke bubbles are confined and forced through tight chambers and are constantly interacting with each other.

Submerged pockets of smoke are constantly dividing, collecting, and conjointing.

This ongoing traffic is a given in percolation, but it is actually best for your bubbles to be seperated.

Luckily, there are ways to control this separation of bubbles.

This process is referred to as diffusion, and it’s a big game changer in percolation.

## What’s the Deal With Diffusion?

Diffusion is defined as the spreading of something more widely—in smoking, diffusion is the division of smoke bubbles.

A higher quantity of smaller smoke bubbles is actually more susceptible to the effects of percolation than a lesser amount of larger bubbles.

Although diffusion isn't necessarily a direct benefit, it is a massive factor in strengthening the cooling, hydrating, and filtering aspects mentioned previously.

Here's why:

H2O can only interact and affect water by making contact with the surface, or perimeter, of a smoke bubble.

Because water only affects smoke bubbles through surface contact, a higher surface-to-volume ratio will allow for a stronger effect in percolation.

Call me Alburnt Einstoned, because this is where stoner math comes into play:

To simulate the diffusion of a bubble, we use the division of volume in spheres.

Fortunately, spheres have the largest surface-to-volume ratio, meaning bubbles are already ahead of the game.

However, by dividing this volume, the results yield an even higher surface area in relation to the volume split.

This may be hard to picture, but we'll give you an example:

Let’s look at a single bubble with a volume of 1 cubic inch.

This single bubble embodies a surface area of 4.836 inches squared.

However, if we divide this bubble into two seperate bubbles (with a volume of .5 cubic inches each), they now float with a surface area of 3.0465 inches squared. Multiply this surface area by 2 (to equate to the same volume as the single bubble) and you'll find a surface volume of 6.093 inches squared.

So the division of one bubble results in a higher surface-to-volume ratio.

## Glass Percolators and Bongs: What to Look For

Glass percolators are generally welded into percolator bongs, and you can check the weld of these devices to see how well the bong was made.

If the weld looks bulky and sloppy, recognize that this job was not done by a master; don’t pay top dollar for any poorly crafted piece.

Looking for solid and cleanly welded pieces with thick glass is the best way to spot durability.

Recycler percolators—recyclers are water pipes that routes smoke through chambers as a circuit.

Any access smoke that isn’t inhaled gets sent back through to the original chamber for another cycle. This process is said to keep your smoke from getting stale—therefore maintaining freshness in your inhales.

## Do Bongs Get You Higher? 

Yes, bongs definitely get you higher, especially when compared to a blunt or a joint – they even get you higher than a bowl. 

Aside from dab rigs, bongs are the best way to get high. 

The water in a bong makes each hit more tolerable, thanks to percolation. 

If you think about it, when you're smoking a blunt or a joint, they're always smoking, even when you're not hitting it. 

That's wasted smoke and, as a consequence, wasted THC. 

Bongs are much more economical – they give you the best high for your supply. 

Lastly, when you are ripping a bong, *much* more smoke gathers in the chamber. When you clear the bong, you're getting way more smoke in your lungs than with a bowl or a joint, which means more THC is going to your brain. 

## Conclusion 

Diffusion increases surface area by dividing volume.
This division further encourages all effects of percolation.

The example of a single bubble dividing only once is only a fraction of reality.

In fact, remember how I mentioned that we can control the separation of bubbles?

Well, a percolator devices—or percs—can perform ridiculous amounts of diffusion for huge boosts in the percolation process.

Percs, also referred to as percolators, utilize tons of tiny slits or holes (depending on the design) to diffuse smoke bubbles into flurries of tiny bubbles.

These flurries massively increase the amount of bubbles formed out of a given volume of smoke.

As you can imagine, this big disbursement of smoke results in great surface area-to-volume ratio when compared to a water pipe without a perc.

There are countless types of percs that can range from simple slitted downstems, to intricate double layered tree perks, ufo percs, honeycomb percs, and much more.

Some bongs and rigs host multiple percolators—delivering a flurry of tiny aerated bubbles into a number of the pipe’s chambers upon inhale.

Real talk:

When it comes to conserving herb and sending your rotation to the moon, [bongs](/pieces/bongs/) are king.

That being said, you may find yourself asking how bongs work, and why are they so damn effective?

We’re going to cover everything from the basics on how to use a bong, to the science behind bong percolation and weed diffusion. 

So, it's time to spark up and zone in—it’s time to get Smokephisticated.

## What is a Bong Used For? 
![How does a bong work header image](/images/bongs/how-does-a-bong-work-header.jpg){: .img-right}

A bong is used to smoke cannabis while utilizing the benefits of percolation. 

This process helps to cool smoke, hydrate inhales, and filter contaminants (ash, tar, herb). 

Bongs are a good method for conserving your supply while simultaneously delivering smooth rips of smoke. 

## How Does a Bong Work? 

As opposed to dry pipes, a bong works by using water percolation and diffusion to make rips much smoother.

A vacuum-like air tight design forces smoke to bubble and diffuse as it travels through water, while water affects smoke in an entirely different way (more on this later!).

## Do Bongs get You Higher than Blunts? 

Think about it this way: 

When you're smoking a bunt, the cherry (the end of the blunt that's lit) is always rolling. 

<img alt="girl smoking a bong" class="lazyload img-left" data-src="/images/bongs/stoner-girl-hitting-a-bong.jpg">

That means marijuana is being burned, even when you're not inhaling. 

Moreover, when you're smoking a blunt, there isn't any water to cool or filter the smoke, meaning the hits are going to be more harsh than a bong. 

Lastly, blunts don't have a collection chamber for the smoke. Unlike a bong, which allows you to collect smoke in a large chamber before clearing the whole thing at once, blunts burn straight into your lung. 

They hit more harshly, and the hits aren't as big. 

Aside from a dab rig, bongs are the best way to smoke. 

## Bong Science: Weed Percolation & Water Diffusion

As a method of smoking cannabis, bongs are flavorful, conservative, and satisfying to watch.

However, bongs—also referred to as water pipes—have one key advantage over dry hand pipes, joints, and blunts.

This advantage is the process of [percolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation){: target="_blank"}.

This bubbly phenomenon cools, hydrates, and filters polar contaminants from the smoke.

<img alt="Bong water percolation basic diagram" class="lazyload img-middle" data-src="/images/bongs/basic-percolation-diagram.jpg">

With regards to smoking, percolation is a fancy way of referring to what happens when smoke is entirely surrounded by water.

Although bongs can drastically vary in size, structure, and design, all true bongs have the capacity to hold water, thus utilizing percolation.

So, are all water pipes are percolator bongs?

Well, not necessarily.

<img alt="percolation example" class="lazyload img-middle" data-src="/images/bongs/percolation-example.gif">

Although every bong is capable of percolation, pipes referred to as percolator bongs host percolator devices that diffuse your smoke for stronger percolation effects.

We’ll cover percolator devices—also referred to as percs later on.

Most stoners understand that a water bong causes a smoother hit, but a truly Smokephisticated toker understands the hows and whys of this process.

First things first, let’s talk about percolation. 

## What's the Point of Water in a Bong? 

When it comes to bongs, water is pretty important.

Water cools and filters smoke, while hydrating your inhales. 

Without any water for herb smoke to interact with, a bong is basically a dry pipe with loose hits.

## What is Percolation? 

The word percolation is defined as the process of straining liquid through a filter. 

This stems from the Latin term percolare, which directly translates as: to strain through. 

There are different forms of percolation that take effect throughout the world—like when you’re brewing a pot of coffee—but the percolation that we will be referring to is the process of cannabis smoke bubbling through water.

<img alt="Bong percolating" class="lazyload img-middle" data-src="/images/bongs/bong-percolating.gif">

All of the effects begin when your bubbles submerge in the water until they resurface. A longer percolation process gives water more time to affect your weed smoke, resulting in a smoother hit.

Different pipes that use water have different routes to diffuse cannabis smoke depending on their structure (more on this later), but the premise of percolation has solid advantages. 

Enough beating around the kush—let's dive into the three main effects of smoking out of a percolator bong:

## Benefits of Percolation 

There are many benefits of percolation, including: 

### 1. Cooler Smoke 

The difference in temperature between smoke and aerated water causes a heat transfer, resulting in cooler smoke and more enjoyable hits.

<div class="toker-tip">
	<h4>Toker Tip<i class="box-icon-spacing fas fa-check"></i></h4>
	<p>Add ice to your bong water.</p>

	<p>Even room-temperature water will cool smoke – but if you use ice water instead, your rips will be frosty and smooth.</p>

	<p>Many bongs also feature an ice-catcher attachment that cools the smoke after percolation. However, some studies have shown that the frost from ice cubes are inhaled, which can damage your airways and lead to bronchitis.</p>

	<p>Inhaling tiny ice shards can mostly be avoided by rinsing the ice cubes, or letting them defrost in the pipe for a few minutes.</p>
</div>

### 2. Hydrated Inhales

As hot smoke travels through water, steam is introduced into each smoke bubble.

That same temperature difference that cools the smoke also fills your future inhale with steam. 

This process adds a smooth vapor-like property to your bong rips without diluting flavor or [THC (not to be confused with CBD)](https://cbdoilreview.org/cbd-cannabidiol/thc-cbd/){: target="_blank}.

### 3. Filtration 

Water, or H2O, pulls/attracts residual particles and filters your smoke on a magnetic molecular level.

The magnetic relationship between H2O and polar contaminants/particles is much simpler than it sounds. Here's the deal:

## The Chemistry Breakdown 

Put simply, polar molecules attract other polar molecules.

Water is very polar; H2O is actually the most polar protic solvent. Substances that can pull through bowls like residual herb, resin, or ash are polar as well — some of the harmful shit that you're usually inhaling through a dry pipe is magnetically pulled from smoke as it passes through water.

<div class="watch-out">
	<h4>Watch Out<i class="box-icon-spacing fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i></h4>
	<p>Stoner bros will sometimes claim that you will lose out on your precious THC in the percolation process, and you’ll dull your high by smoking from a water pipe.</p>

	<p>That's not the case.</p>

	<p>Here's why:</p>
</div>

## Is THC Lost Due Using a Bong?
<img alt="THC diagram" class="img-middle lazyload" data-src="/images/bongs/thc.jpg">

Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is a lipid (examples of lipids would be oils or fats) meaning THC is mostly non-polar. 

That being said, water does not magnetically pull THC out of your smoke as it does with polar particles; you may lose trace amounts of THC, but it wouldn’t be anything to fiend over.

If you compare the number of harmful particles that are pulled from your inhales, to the trace amount of THC lost—percolation is worth the miniscule trade.

Smoother rips are also much easier to inhale, which allows you to take larger hits compared to a dry piece.

So at the end of the day, you're getting bigger and cleaner rips. Larger inhales = more THC per rip.

With that being said, that stoner bro probably heard the same claim by another smoker who is also uninformed. Break the cycle with your newfound facts on percolation.

## Bubbles Stay Busy

When smoke submerges, it doesn’t enter as one single bodied pocket. Instead, smoke bubbles into many little bodies before returning to air.

But between the submersion and resurfacing, these smoke bubbles are confined and forced through tight chambers and are constantly interacting with each other.

<img alt="bong sitting on table" class="lazyload img-right" data-src="/images/bongs/pretty-bong-on-table.jpg">

Submerged pockets of smoke are constantly dividing, collecting, and conjoining.

This ongoing underwater bong traffic is inevitable in percolation, but it is actually beneficial for your bubbles to be as seperated as possible.

Luckily, there are ways to control this separation of bubbles.

This process is referred to as diffusion, and it’s a big game changer in percolation.

## What’s the Deal With Diffusion?

Diffusion is defined as the spreading of something more widely—in smoking, diffusion is the division of smoke bubbles.

A higher quantity of smaller smoke bubbles is actually more susceptible to the effects of percolation than a lesser amount of larger bubbles.

<img alt="diffusion diagram" class="lazyload img-middle" data-src="/images/bongs/diffusion-diagram.jpg">

Although diffusion isn't necessarily a direct benefit, it is a massive factor in strengthening the cooling, hydrating, and filtering aspects mentioned previously.

Here's why:

H2O can only interact and affect water by making contact with the surface, or perimeter, of a smoke bubble.

Because water only affects smoke bubbles through surface contact, a higher surface-to-volume ratio will allow for a stronger effect in percolation.

Call me Alburnt Einstoned, because this is where stoner math comes into play:

<img alt="albert einstein weed quote" class="lazyload img-middle" data-src="/images/bongs/einstein-quote.jpg">

To simulate the diffusion of a bubble, we use the division of volume in spheres.

Fortunately, spheres have the largest surface-to-volume ratio, meaning bubbles are already ahead of the game.

However, by dividing this volume, the results yield an even higher surface area in relation to the volume split.

This may be hard to picture, but we'll give you an example:

Let’s look at a single bubble with a volume of 1 cubic inch.

This single bubble embodies a surface area of 4.836 inches squared.

However, if we divide this bubble into two seperate bubbles (with a volume of .5 cubic inches each), they now float with a surface area of 3.0465 inches squared. Multiply this surface area by 2 (to equate to the same volume as the single bubble) and you'll find a surface volume of 6.093 inches squared.

So the division of one bubble results in a higher surface-to-volume ratio.

## Glass Percolators and Bongs: What to Look For

Glass percolators are generally welded into percolator bongs – the quality of the weld is a great way to determine the quality of the bong. 

If the weld looks bulky and sloppy, recognize that this job was not done by a master; don’t pay top dollar for a poorly crafted piece.

You should also keep your eye out for recyclers. 

Recyclers are water pipes that routes smoke through chambers as a circuit.

Any access smoke that isn’t inhaled gets sent back through to the original chamber for another cycle. This process is said to keep your smoke from getting stale, thus ensuring fresh inhales.

## How to Use a Bong 
<img alt="bong bowl pack" class="lazyload img-right" data-src="/images/bongs/bong-bowl-pack.jpg">
Using a bong is pretty easy, and they get you high as fuck. Here's a quick tutorial that will show you how to use a bong, step by step: 

### 1. Pack The Bowl 

Pack your bowl with ground weed – you don't have to grind it, but the weed will burn more efficiently, thus conserving your weed. You'll get higher, too. 

### 2. Rip The Bong 

Take a few deep breaths to prepare, and empty your lungs until they're about 80% empty. 

You want to have a bit of extra air in your lungs so that, when you're done ripping the bong, you have extra air to blow the smoke out of your lungs. 

Otherwise, you won't be able to blow out all of the smoke, and you'll start coughing. 

<img alt="girl ripping a bong" class="lazyload img-middle" data-src="/images/bongs/girl-ripping-bong.gif">

Put your mouth over the top of the bong, ensuring an air tight seal. 

Begin pulling hard enough to cause the water to bubble. Light the lighter over the bowl. 

<div class="watch-out">
	<h4>Watch Out<i class="box-icon-spacing fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i></h4>
		
		<p>Don't hold the lighter on the bowl piece for too long.</p> 

		<p>It should only take one or two seconds before the bowl ignites.</p>

		<p>After that, remove the lighter. The weed will burn on its own.</p>

		<p>If you hold the lighter there too long, you'll torch the weed. </p>
</div>

### 3. Clear The Bong 
<img alt="how to use a bong" class="lazyload img-right" data-src="/images/bongs/hitting-bong.gif">

Once the bong is full of milky smoke, it's time to clear it. 

Some bongs have a shotgun (carb hole) while others have a removeable bowl piece. 

Take your finger off of the shotgun or remove the bowl piece, depending on your bong's design. 

Next, inhale hard and fast. You'll clear all of the smoke from the bong, and inhale it into your lungs. 

You'll be high as fuck in no time!

## Conclusion 

Diffusion increases surface area by dividing volume.

This division further encourages all effects of percolation.

The example of a single bubble dividing only once is only a fraction of reality.

In fact, remember how I mentioned that we can control the separation of bubbles?

Well, a percolator devices—or percs—can perform ridiculous amounts of diffusion for huge boosts in the percolation process.

Percs, also referred to as percolators, utilize tons of tiny slits or holes (depending on the design) to diffuse smoke bubbles into flurries of tiny bubbles.

These flurries massively increase the amount of bubbles formed out of a given volume of smoke.

As you can imagine, this big disbursement of smoke results in great surface area-to-volume ratio when compared to a water pipe without a perc.

There are countless types of percs that can range from simple slitted downstems, to intricate double layered tree perks, ufo percs, honeycomb percs, and much more.

Some bongs and rigs host multiple percolators—delivering a flurry of tiny aerated bubbles into a number of the pipe’s chambers upon inhale.

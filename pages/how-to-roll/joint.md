For a long time, I would just smoke the joints that my friends rolled for me. 

Then, everything changed.

I decided I wanted to learn how to roll a joint myself – no longer would I dependent on anyone else when I wanted to smoke a doobie. 

Here's the thing: 

Rolling – at least, rolling *well* – takes some time. 

You're going to have to try it a few times, and maybe another time after that. 

But hey, look on the bright side: 

At least you'll get to smoke all of them!

	<h4>Stoner Story<i class="box-icon-spacing fas fa-book"></i></h4>

	<p>Towards the end of my senior year of high school, I started learning how to roll.</p> 

	<p>By the time summer rolled around, I could roll a pretty big doobie in a few minutes.</p> 

	<p>Naturally, on the evening of graduation, I decided to roll a joint.</p> 

	<p>I went to my friend's house because his mother wasn't *supposed* to be home.</p> 

	<p>I made a fire in their firepit, sparked the joint, got baked with my friends, and relaxed.</p>

	<p>Next thing I know, my buddy's mom is standing in the doorway, looking right at me.</p>

	<p>Up until this point, I thought she'd cut my balls off for smoking weed, especially on her property...</p> 

	<p>Next thing I know, she pulls out a joint of her own, sits down next to me, and starts smoking.</p>

	<p>Go figure!</p>

Here’s the deal: 

There’s nothing more relaxing than sitting down with your friends and unwinding over a phat (with a ph) king-sized joint. 

I mean, look at this thing:

Beautiful, isn’t it? 

And hey, if blunts are more your thing, that’s cool too bro. 

Smoking a fat doink is awesome. So is getting high, for that matter.

Unfortunately, rolling isn’t as easy as it looks, especially if it’s your first time. Snoop Dogg didn’t learn how to roll overnight, and neither will you. 

## The Art of Rolling: How Do You Roll? 

Rolling is an art that takes time and practice. It took me a long while and too many wasted joint papers and blunt wraps before I learned how to roll a fat doink. 

When I first started rolling, I quickly became frustrated. 

I’d rip the joint paper when I was trying to roll, the glue never seemed to stick, and sometimes when I managed to roll a joint, it didn’t seem to burn well at all. 

Now I smoke big doinks only, and I’ve learned a substantial amount about rolling along the way.

That’s why I’ve created this guide – I’m going to give you all of the tips I wish I knew when I tried to roll for the first time. 

You won’t be a joint rolling Jedi master immediately, but the information in this article will surely save you time, headaches, and torn wraps. 

Consider me your joint rolling Obi-Wan Kenobi and you’re my young padawan.

And if you haven’t seen Star Wars, here’s a quick translation: 

I’m your weed rolling master, and I’m going to get you hip to some dank rolling tips. 

Without further ado, let’s get smokephisticated.

If you want to learn how to roll – either a blunt, a joint, or a backwood – then you should check out one of our step-by-step tutorials listed above. 

In this guide, we’re going to cover the basic rolling techniques that you can apply to every type of roll, regardless of the wrap you’re using. 
Rolling Tools 
Before you get rolling you’re going to need a few tools, some of which are absolutely necessary, while others are just convenient. 

Either way, all of these rolling tools will make your life a whole hell of a lot easier. 

Buy a grinder: A grinder is a stoner’s best friend, and for good reason. 

If you’re rolling a joint, you’ll need to be using a grinder. Sure, you could break up the weed with your hands, but the joint wouldn’t smoke well at all. 

Joint papers are too thin to smoke without ground up weed – the paper will burn more quickly than the weed, and you’ll be out of luck. 

On the other hand, blunts are an entirely different story. 

Although you can use a grinder for blunts, I find it better – and in fact, easier – to roll blunts without grinding up the weed. 

Instead, I’d recommend picking the weed apart by hand into tiny pieces. You can also grind up weed for a blunt if you wish, but it won’t smoke as well. 

Oh, and here’s another great thing about grinders: they gather your keef! 

If you don’t know what kief is, you’re definitely missing out. It’s basically all of the tiny THC crystals that fall off of the weed and it’s super strong. 

Grind up enough weed and before you know it you’ll have enough kief to pack a bowl! 

Toker tip: 

If you’ve been grinding up nug after nug, you probably have a ton of keef and little bits of weed stuck in your grinder that hasn’t fallen down into the collection chambers. 

This next part may seem crazy, but trust me – it works: 

Take your grinder, put a penny in the main weed collection chamber, and then put your grinder in the freezer for ten minutes. 

Lastly, take the grinder out and shake it for about a minute. 

When you unscrew the grinder and take a look at the kief catcher, you’ll notice a significant amount of kief has fallen down for your enjoyment. 

Get a Poker: I didn’t really know what else to call this one, so just go with it, okay? 

Basically, you’ll want to have something like a pen or pencil with you that you can use to maneuver the weed in the joint and pack the weed tightly after the rolling is complete. 

I like to use the tip of a mechanical pencil while I’m sitting at my desk – aka the rolling station – to move the weed around in my joint because when I use my fingers, sometimes the weed sticks to it. 

Once the joint has been rolled, I usually have some extra room at the end where I stick the pencil to pack the weed further down into the joint. The key to a nice joint is a tight roll!

Heads up: 

Don’t pack the joint too tightly!

Didn’t I just tell you to pack the weed with a pencil?


Well, yes, you want the joint to be firm. Still, if you pack the weed too tightly you’ll prevent air from flowing through the joint properly, and it’ll go out while you’re trying to chief. 

Nobody wants a dud doobie! 

Anyway, definitely keep a poker at the ready. 

Toker tip: 

You can remove the flint wheel from a RAW lighter and use it as a poker. This is a great feature, regardless of whether you’re rolling a joint or a blunt!

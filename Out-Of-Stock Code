When the typical smoker thinks of *gravity bong*, an image of a dirty cut-up 2-liter bottle inside of a bucket filled with water may come to mind. Generally the bowl would have been made from a socket jammed into a hole in the plastic cap, but as sketchy as these contraptions were... They delivered. 

Something about hitting a gravity bong gets you to a different high; one that bowls and regular bongs just can't always serve, all while using the least amount of your supply.

**Now, let me introduce to you: the Grav Bong, by Nucleus.**

<a target="_blank" href="https://dankstop.com/products/nucleus-grav-bong?aff=1112"><img alt="Grav Labs Gravitron Gravity Bong - XL" class="img-middle" src="/img/bongs/gravitron-gravity-bong.png" /></a>

Relive the glory days of hiding from your parents behind your shed and highschool-party craftsmanship with this sleek, even more effective, glass replacement.

Replacing those sketchy plastics and metals with glass, the Gravitron features a base for water, a glass funnel for you to pack your tabacco or herb of choice into, a rubber stopper to prevent glass-on-glass collision, and of course the bottle pipe to lift for the artificial inhale.

If you search for the MediBubler online you'll find the same phrase everywhere: **"Guarenteed to be smooth."**

Wheather you're looking to produce tiny tokes or massive clouds; this thing is known for being easy on the lungs.

**And there's good reason behind that:**

This bong is equipped with a variety of features to support that milky smoooth claim, including:

* The charming body shaped like a water-holding bubble.

* A removable glass mouthpiece that expands outwards towards to lips for comfortble mouth purchase.

* A removable glass slide to make clening jobs a breeze.

	* On the glass slide is a 7-slitted inline percolator that provides filteration in your smoke; diffusing harmful particles from your inhales. Percolation also helps produce way more, tinier bubbles to seperate your smoke and cool your hits in rips big and small.

* Toward the top of the MediBubbler's bosy is a Carb hole for additional airflow with just the lift of a finger.

**The MediBubbler is smokephistication in it's finest.**
